===========================================

This repository serves as a template both in how to write a report, and how
to do so in RStudio and Bookdown. The parent repository is available as a free
template at [https://github.com/byu-transpolab/template_bookdown](https://github.com/byu-transpolab/template_bookdown).

The advice in this document comes from numerous sources. Some of it is my own, some
has been shared by others. Particular note belongs to:

The introduction of your report is not simply an "introduction", but rather a

  1. Identify the problem and why it matters.
  2. A high-level overview of some previous attempts to solve it, and why those 
  attempts were limited (this might be two paragraphs).
  2. Describe the approach (very briefly), and provide an overview of what is 
  to come. "In this paper we present ..."
